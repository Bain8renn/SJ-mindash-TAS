This is a repository containing all the files for the Strawberry Jam Collab Mindash TAS. It includes menuing, the lobby files and the level files, as well as 4 different categories to choose from.

If you want to play this TAS on your pc please read the instructions in the "0-All.tas" file in the corresponding category.

There are 3 Separate categories :
- Restricted ("R"): doesn't allow spinner stunning or spinner freezing)
- Semi-Restricted ("SR"): allows spinner stunning but not spinner freezing)
- Restricted ("U"): allows both spinner stunning and spinner freezing)
- All Red Berries Restricted ("ARBR" or just "ARB"): Collect all of the red berry collectables throughout the mod. No stunning or freezing.

R has been drafted, but could always use improvements. SR, U, and ARB have many levels that aren't finished yet.
